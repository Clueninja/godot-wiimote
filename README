#XWiimote-Godot

XWiimote-Godot is a GNU/Linux shared library API for communication between godot GDscript to the xwiimote module API. This can be used to move player objects in Godot games.

until Creating a simple Plugin

## Building xwiimote-godot
run 
'$ scons platform=linux target=release'
 in the module folder.
 
This will create 'libxwiimote-godot.so' in the '/wiimote/bin/x11' directory which will execute when the library is loaded from gdscript.

To change the target directory to your program eg example edit the SConstruct file line 14 from 'wiimote/bin' to 'example/bin'
